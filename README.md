Car brand recognizer

The "Car Brand Recognition Project" is a machine learning initiative aimed at identifying car brands from images using a neural network. The project focuses on recognizing specific brands and models, including Audi, Hyundai Creta, Mahindra Scorpio, Rolls Royce, Swift, Tata Safari, and Toyota Innova.

By leveraging a deep learning-based image classification model, the system is trained on a labeled dataset of car images to accurately classify these brands and models. This project has potential applications in traffic monitoring, automated parking systems, and car dealership analytics.

The neural network will be designed and trained using state-of-the-art frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, utilizing techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features and ensure high accuracy in brand recognition.
